    Cleans up workspaces from this job's old builds on other agent nodes.
    <p>
    By default, a agent node will leave a build's workspace on the agent node's filesystem
    indefinitely (until it gets overwritten by a new build).
    When there's a (large) pool of persistent agent nodes available to run a (large) number of builds,
    eventually every agent node ends up with a copy of every builds' workspace.
    This is a waste of hardware resources as Jenkins will only look at the workspace on the most
    recently used agent node.
    <br>
    This functionality triggers a clean up of the workspace on all agent nodes
    that are not currently being used so that, on average, the pool of agents will only
    contain one workspace for each job.
