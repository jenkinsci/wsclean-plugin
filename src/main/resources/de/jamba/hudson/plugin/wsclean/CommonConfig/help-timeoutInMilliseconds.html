<div>
    Sets a time limit in milliseconds for the clean-up to complete.
    <p>
    If set to a positive number and the clean-up operation takes longer than permitted, it will be aborted.  This will <em>not</em> cause the build to fail.
    <br>
    Otherwise the clean-up is allowed to run indefinitely.
    <p>
    Note: If an agent node locks up, it can cause all operations run on that node to also lock up, which includes the clean-up operation.
    If you do not set a timeout then a single deadlocked node can cause all your builds to lock up until that agent is killed.
